# comics-gnrt-sass

A comics generator - small project with HTML / CSS / JS and SASS preprocessor.

Edit the style.scss file to modify style.

Edit the Javascript file to add your drawing and dialogue.

Currently, you have a limitation of 6 panels max within a single page.

If you want more panels, you have to edit HTML and SCSS files too.

Here we have the result (github-pages) : [comics-gnrt](https://quentgh.github.io/comics-gnrt-sass/)


## Prerequisites
SASS preprocessor - scss syntax was used on this project.


## Next steps
- Add form to edit your own comics with a simple (friendly) interface
- Rebuild HTML and CSS files to have a dynamic page
- Clean CSS rules (optimizations)
